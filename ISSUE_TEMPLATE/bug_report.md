**What happened?**
A clear description of the bug.

**What did you expect to happen?**


**Where did it get stuck?**
- [ ] File wouldn't upload at all
- [ ] Stalled during analysis (note the % if visible)
- [ ] Analysis completed but no/wrong issues shown
- [ ] Issues display but something else is broken
- [ ] Other (describe below)

**Your browser:**
(e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Arc)

**How to share your data file:**
If the issue might be related to your specific data, please attach your CSV:
- Rename it from `filename.csv` to `filename.csv.txt` (GitHub doesn't allow .csv uploads)
- Or zip it and upload the .zip
- For display issues, the first 500-1000 rows is usually enough
- For stalling/parsing issues, we probably need the whole file

**Screenshots:**
If helpful, add screenshots showing the issue.

**Console errors (if you're comfortable checking):**
1. Open browser developer tools (Cmd+Option+J on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows)
2. Look for any red error messages
3. Copy/paste or screenshot them here
