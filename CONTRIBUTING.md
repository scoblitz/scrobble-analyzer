## Code Contributions

I'm not accepting pull requests at this time. This is a personal project and I'm not equipped to review code contributions effectively.

If you've got a code fix you think is important, feel free to describe it in an Issue and I'll see if I can implement it.

## About This Project

Scrobble Analyzer is built in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). It's a learning project as much as a tool, and I appreciate everyone's patience as it evolves!
